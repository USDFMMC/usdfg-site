🏆 **USDFG Arena Tournament Update** 🏆

We've just rolled out major improvements to our Tournament (Bracket Mode) system! Here's what's new:

✨ **What's New:**

🎯 **Better Tournament Creation Flow**
• Tournament option now appears in Step 1 alongside Solo/Team
• Choose your bracket size (4, 8, or 16 players) right from the start
• Cleaner, more intuitive challenge creation process

⚡ **Streamlined Tournament Experience**
• Auto-opens tournament lobby when you join
• Real-time bracket updates as players join
• See your matchup instantly when Round 1 starts

🎮 **Submit Results Directly**
• New "Submit Result" button in tournament lobby
• No trust reviews for tournaments = faster matches, less data usage
• Results process instantly

🔒 **Fair Play Protection**
• Both players must submit results before bracket advances
• Prevents premature advancement
• Automatic winner determination when results match

📊 **Live Bracket View**
• Watch the tournament fill up in real-time
• See all matches, winners, and progress
• Integrated chat and voice for each match

**How It Works:**
1. Create Tournament → Select bracket size (4/8/16 players)
2. Players Join → Tournament lobby opens automatically
3. Round 1 Starts → When bracket fills, matches begin
4. Submit Results → Both players submit, winner advances
5. Champion Crowned → Last player standing receives the challenge reward!

💰 **Challenge Reward = Challenge Amount × Number of Players**

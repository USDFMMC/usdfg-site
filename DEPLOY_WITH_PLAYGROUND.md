# üéÆ Deploy Smart Contract Using Solana Playground

## Why Solana Playground?
- ‚úÖ No local build tools needed
- ‚úÖ Build and deploy in the browser
- ‚úÖ Used by many professional developers
- ‚úÖ Works 100% of the time
- ‚úÖ Takes 5 minutes

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Go to Solana Playground
Open: **https://beta.solpg.io**

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet
1. Click **"Connect"** in the top right
2. Select **"Import from Filesystem"**
3. Navigate to: `~/.config/solana/id.json`
4. Click **"Import"**

Your wallet with **4.33 SOL** will be connected! ‚úÖ

### Step 3: Create New Project
1. Click **"Create new project"**
2. Name it: `usdfg-smart-contract`
3. Select: **"Anchor (Rust)"**

### Step 4: Replace the Code
1. In the left sidebar, find `lib.rs`
2. Delete all the default code
3. Copy your contract from:
   ```
   /Users/husseinali/Downloads/CryptoTracker 2/USDFGAMING-full-project/USDFG GitHub/usdfg-site/programs/usdfg_smart_contract/src/lib.rs
   ```
4. Paste it into Solana Playground

### Step 5: Update the Program ID
1. In Solana Playground, look at the bottom-left
2. You'll see: **"Program ID: [some address]"**
3. Copy that address
4. Replace line 7 in your code:
   ```rust
   declare_id!("PASTE_THE_PROGRAM_ID_HERE");
   ```

### Step 6: Build
1. Click **"Build"** button (or press Ctrl/Cmd + S)
2. Wait for it to compile (takes 30-60 seconds)
3. You should see: **"Build successful ‚úÖ"**

### Step 7: Deploy
1. Make sure you're on **Devnet** (check top right)
2. Click **"Deploy"** button
3. Approve the transaction in your wallet
4. Wait for deployment (takes 10-20 seconds)
5. You should see: **"Deployment successful ‚úÖ"**

### Step 8: Copy Your Program ID
After deployment, you'll see the program ID. Copy it!

It should be: `7FcxBoY7313QbsyN9oqGvpJBLGw9B984W18RgZgHPpaY`

## üîÑ Update Your Frontend

### Step 1: Verify Program ID in Frontend
Check that your `config.ts` already has the correct ID:
```bash
cd "/Users/husseinali/Downloads/CryptoTracker 2/USDFGAMING-full-project/USDFG GitHub/usdfg-site"
grep PROGRAM_ID client/src/lib/chain/config.ts
```

Should show: `7FcxBoY7313QbsyN9oqGvpJBLGw9B984W18RgZgHPpaY`

### Step 2: Download IDL from Playground
1. In Solana Playground, click **"IDL"** tab
2. Click **"Download IDL"**
3. Save it to: `client/src/lib/chain/usdfg_smart_contract.json`

### Step 3: Rebuild Frontend
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

### Step 4: Deploy Frontend
Upload the `dist/` folder to your hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

## ‚úÖ Verification

### Check Your Deployment on Solana Explorer:
https://explorer.solana.com/address/7FcxBoY7313QbsyN9oqGvpJBLGw9B984W18RgZgHPpaY?cluster=devnet

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Program deployed
- ‚úÖ Program owned by BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e
- ‚úÖ Your wallet as upgrade authority

---

## üéâ Done!

Your contract is now:
- ‚úÖ Deployed to Solana devnet
- ‚úÖ Oracle-free and working
- ‚úÖ Ready for users to create challenges

**Test it:**
Go to your site and create a challenge - no more oracle errors! üöÄ

---

## üìù Notes

- Your Program ID: `7FcxBoY7313QbsyN9oqGvpJBLGw9B984W18RgZgHPpaY`
- Network: Devnet
- Upgrade Authority: Your wallet
- Cost: ~2 SOL for deployment (you have 4.33 SOL ‚úÖ)

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**"Build Failed"**
- Check your Rust code for syntax errors
- Make sure the program ID in `declare_id!()` matches the one shown in Playground

**"Deployment Failed"**
- Make sure you're connected to your wallet
- Check you have enough SOL (need ~2 SOL)
- Verify you're on Devnet (top right corner)

**"Transaction Failed"**
- Wait a few seconds and try again
- Devnet can be slow sometimes

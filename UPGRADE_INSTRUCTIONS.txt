The deployed contract at 3UCz8aURYFXUqNWgHDfbiRziVKjPB8G7BYrgj93MyHUp is outdated.

It expects token accounts during challenge creation, but our new code removed that.

You need to either:
1. Upgrade the existing program (if you have upgrade authority)
2. Or deploy a new program and update the frontend config

See DEPLOY_NEW_CONTRACT.md for detailed instructions.

# Check Challenge Status in Firebase

## Current Situation
You keep seeing "already submitted" because you're testing with OLD challenges that already have both results.

## What You Need to Do

### Option 1: Check Firebase Console
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project "usdfg-app"
3. Go to "Firestore Database"
4. Look at the `challenges` collection
5. Find challenge ID: `sSVOIGwUydA4DPWAFFu5`
6. Check the `results` field - does it have **2 entries**?

If YES â†’ Both already submitted, you CANNOT test with this challenge
If NO â†’ Only 1 submitted, switch to the other wallet and submit

### Option 2: Delete All Old Challenges and Start Fresh
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Firestore
2. Delete ALL challenges in the `challenges` collection
3. Go back to your site
4. Create a brand new challenge
5. Join it with wallet 2
6. Submit results (one Yes, one No)
7. Watch for the new logs

### Option 3: Look for the Logs from When Second Player Submitted
If both players already submitted, check if you have logs from when the SECOND player submitted. You should see:
```
âœ… Result submitted: ...
ðŸŽ¯ Both players submitted! Determining winner...
ðŸŽ¯ Determining winner for challenge: sSVOIGwUydA4DPWAFFu5
```

If you don't see those logs, it means the second submission happened BEFORE the fix was deployed.

## The Real Question

**Did you create challenge `sSVOIGwUydA4DPWAFFu5` AFTER the fix was deployed?**

If NO â†’ You need to create a NEW challenge NOW
If YES â†’ Check Firebase to see what happened

---

**The fix ONLY works for NEW submissions after deployment. Old challenges can't be retroactively fixed.**

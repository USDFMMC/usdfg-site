# Cloudflare Pages headers (if using Cloudflare)
# Note: Cloudflare Pages uses Functions for routing, not _redirects

# For Cloudflare Pages, routing is handled via:
# 1. Functions/_middleware.ts (for routing)
# 2. Or _routes.json (for static routing)

# Headers are set in netlify.toml or via Cloudflare Workers

# ⏳ Waiting for Netlify Deployment

## Current Status

✅ Code pushed to GitHub: `a71f6f1c`  
🔄 Netlify is building and deploying...

## What to Do

### Option 1: Wait for Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Check the "Deploys" tab
3. Wait for the green "Published" status (~2-3 minutes)
4. Then hard refresh your site

### Option 2: Force Clear Cache Now
If you want to test immediately:

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Application" tab
3. Click "Clear storage"
4. Check all boxes
5. Click "Clear site data"
6. Close DevTools
7. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

## Issues You're Seeing

Your challenges are stuck in Firestore as `"in-progress"` but they actually only have 1 player. This happened because:

1. Old challenges were created before the fix
2. Firestore status doesn't match on-chain status
3. The sync tried to update them but used the wrong byte position

## Solution

**After the new deployment loads**, these challenges will be properly synced. Or you can:

1. Delete the stuck challenges from Firestore (via Firebase Console)
2. Create fresh challenges with the fixed code

## How to Tell If New Code is Loaded

Look for this in console:
```
🔍 On-chain challenge status: 0
```

If you see that log with debugging info, the new code is loaded! ✅

**Just wait a few minutes for Netlify, then try creating a NEW challenge!** 🚀

## 📢 Copy-paste version

**USDFG Project Update**

We’ve been heads down on the platform. Here’s where things stand:

**Infrastructure & stability**  
We ran a full pass on how the app talks to the backend. We trimmed anything that didn’t directly support core gameplay and rewards. Result: leaner, more predictable behavior and better readiness to scale when we need it.

**Arena & challenges**  
The challenge flow — create, join, fund, resolve — is locked in. We’re not adding complexity there; we’re hardening what we have so matches and payouts stay reliable.

**Community & chat**  
In-lobby chat stays simple and fast. We tuned how often we sync messages so the experience stays smooth without extra overhead.

**What’s next**  
We’re focused on stability, clear UX, and making sure every feature we ship earns its keep. More concrete milestones (and some surprises) when we’re ready to announce.

Thanks for being here.

## Short version (if you need fewer words)

**USDFG Update**

Backend and infra got a cleanup: we cut what wasn’t needed for core gameplay. Arena and challenges are stable; in-lobby chat is tuned. We’re doubling down on reliability and UX. More soon.

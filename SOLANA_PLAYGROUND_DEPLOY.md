# üöÄ Deploy to Solana Playground - Security Fix

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Open Solana Playground
Go to: **https://beta.solpg.io/**

### 2. Copy the Updated Smart Contract

Open the file: `programs/usdfg_smart_contract/src/lib.rs`

Then **replace the ENTIRE file** in Solana Playground with the updated version.

### 3. Build the Contract

In Solana Playground:
1. Click **"Build"** button (hammer icon) 
2. Wait for it to compile
3. Should see: ‚úÖ "Build successful"

### 4. Deploy the Contract

1. Click **"Deploy"** button
2. Make sure you're on **Devnet**
3. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
4. Copy the **Program ID** that appears

### 5. Update the Program ID

**IMPORTANT:** The Program ID should already be:
```
9NBcMx3x8EotQi63fukhXpYbcBRgyWj6PcEFyEaL9oqo
```

If it's different, you'll need to update it in 3 places:
- Line 4 of `lib.rs`: `declare_id!("YOUR_NEW_ID");`
- `Anchor.toml`
- `client/src/lib/chain/config.ts`

### 6. Test It!

After deployment:
1. Refresh your app
2. Try to claim one of the prizes
3. Should work! üéâ

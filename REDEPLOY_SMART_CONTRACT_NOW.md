# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Smart Contract Needs Redeployment

## Problem Identified

The **deployed smart contract** does NOT match the code in `COPY_THIS_TO_PLAYGROUND.rs`!

**Evidence:**
- Line 119 in `COPY_THIS_TO_PLAYGROUND.rs` sets `challenge.status = ChallengeStatus::Open`
- But on-chain, challenges are being created with status `InProgress` (1) instead of `Open` (0)
- This causes ALL join attempts to fail with "Challenge is not open" error

## Solution: Redeploy Smart Contract

### Step 1: Open Solana Playground
1. Go to https://beta.solpg.io
2. Make sure you're logged in with the same wallet

### Step 2: Copy the Correct Code
1. Open `COPY_THIS_TO_PLAYGROUND.rs` in this repository
2. Copy **ALL** the code (from line 1 to end)
3. In Solana Playground:
   - Delete ALL existing code in `lib.rs`
   - Paste the copied code

### Step 3: Build the Program
1. Click **"Build"** button in Playground
2. Wait for compilation to complete
3. You should see "Build successful"

### Step 4: Deploy the Program
1. Click **"Deploy"** button
2. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. **COPY THE NEW PROGRAM ID** that appears after deployment

### Step 5: Update Frontend
After deployment, you'll get a new program ID like:
```
Program Id: XYZ123ABC...
```

**Send me this program ID** and I'll update the frontend to use it.

## Why This Happened

The deployed smart contract is from an older version that had different logic for challenge creation. The current code in `COPY_THIS_TO_PLAYGROUND.rs` is correct, but it hasn't been deployed yet.

## Next Steps After Redeployment

1. I'll update `client/src/lib/chain/config.ts` with the new program ID
2. I'll update `client/src/lib/chain/usdfg_smart_contract.json` with the new program ID
3. Push changes to GitHub (auto-deploys to Netlify)
4. Test the full challenge flow: create â†’ join â†’ submit â†’ claim

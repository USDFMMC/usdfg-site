## 🛠️ If You Need to Redeploy

### Option 1: Using Solana Playground (Recommended)

1. Go to https://beta.solpg.io
2. Paste the code from `COPY_THIS_TO_PLAYGROUND.rs` into `lib.rs`
3. Click **Build** (🔨)
4. Copy the Program ID from bottom-left
5. Update line 4: `declare_id!("YOUR_NEW_ID");`
6. Click **Build** again
7. Click **Deploy** (🚀)
8. Update `client/src/lib/chain/config.ts` with the new program ID
9. Run: `cd client && npm run build`
10. Commit and push to GitHub

### Option 2: Local Deployment (If build tools are fixed)

```bash
cd "/Users/husseinali/Downloads/CryptoTracker 2/USDFGAMING-full-project/USDFG GitHub/usdfg-site"
anchor build
anchor deploy
```

## 📊 Contract Verification

You can verify the contract is deployed by running:

```bash
solana program show 9NBcMx3x8EotQi63fukhXpYbcBRgyWj6PcEFyEaL9oqo --url devnet
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If challenge creation fails:

1. **Check wallet has USDFG tokens**
   ```bash
   spl-token accounts --url devnet
   ```

2. **Check program is deployed**
   ```bash
   solana program show 9NBcMx3x8EotQi63fukhXpYbcBRgyWj6PcEFyEaL9oqo --url devnet
   ```

3. **Check frontend has correct program ID**
   - Open DevTools → Network → Check which program ID is being called
   - Should match: `9NBcMx3x8EotQi63fukhXpYbcBRgyWj6PcEFyEaL9oqo`

4. **Clear browser cache**
   - Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   - Or clear cache in DevTools → Network → Disable cache

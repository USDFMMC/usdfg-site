# Verify Your GitHub Has the New Code

## ‚úÖ Your Local Files Are Correct!

Your local `config.ts` has the NEW program ID:
```
7FcxBoY7313QbsyN9oqGvpJBLGw9B984W18RgZgHPpaY
```

The push was successful. If you're seeing the old ID on GitHub, it's likely browser cache.

## üîç How to Verify on GitHub

### Step 1: Hard Refresh GitHub

Go to your repository and do a **hard refresh**:

**On Mac:**
- Press: `Command + Shift + R` (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)
- Or: `Command + Option + R` (Safari)

**On Windows:**
- Press: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)
- Or: `Ctrl + F5` (most browsers)

### Step 2: Check the Latest Commit

1. Go to: https://github.com/USDFMMC/usdfg-site
2. Look at the top - you should see: "üöÄ Complete Oracle Removal & New Smart Contract Setup"
3. Click on the commit to see what changed

### Step 3: View the File Directly

Go directly to the config file:
https://github.com/USDFMMC/usdfg-site/blob/main/client/src/lib/chain/config.ts

You should see line 13:
```typescript
export const PROGRAM_ID = new PublicKey('7FcxBoY7313QbsyN9oqGvpJBLGw9B984W18RgZgHPpaY');
```

### Step 4: Check Commit History

Go to: https://github.com/USDFMMC/usdfg-site/commits/main

You should see commit `65805888` at the top with all the changes.

## üì± Try Incognito/Private Mode

Open the GitHub page in an incognito/private window:

- **Firefox**: `Command + Shift + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows)
- **Safari**: `Command + Shift + N`

Then go to: https://github.com/USDFMMC/usdfg-site/blob/main/client/src/lib/chain/config.ts

---

## ‚úÖ What Should You See?

On line 13 of `client/src/lib/chain/config.ts`:

```typescript
// Smart Contract Program ID (deployed on devnet) - NEW UPDATED CONTRACT
// Old contract: 2KL4BKvUtDmABvuvRopkCEb33myWM1W9BGodAZ82RWDT
// New contract: 7FcxBoY7313QbsyN9oqGvpJBLGw9B984W18RgZgHPpaY
export const PROGRAM_ID = new PublicKey('7FcxBoY7313QbsyN9oqGvpJBLGw9B984W18RgZgHPpaY');
```

## üîç Double-Check: Are You on the Right Branch?

Make sure you're viewing the **main** branch:
- Look at the top left of GitHub
- It should say "Branch: main"
- If it says something else, click it and select "main"

---

## üìä Verify the Commit Was Pushed

Run this in Terminal to confirm:

```bash
cd "/Users/husseinali/Downloads/CryptoTracker 2/USDFGAMING-full-project/USDFG GitHub/usdfg-site"
git log origin/main --oneline -1
```

You should see:
```
65805888 üöÄ Complete Oracle Removal & New Smart Contract Setup
```

## üÜò Still Seeing Old ID?

If you're absolutely sure GitHub shows the old ID after trying all the above:

### Check Which File You're Looking At

Make sure you're viewing:
- ‚úÖ `client/src/lib/chain/config.ts` (this has the program ID)
- ‚ùå NOT `client/src/lib/chain/usdfg_smart_contract.json` (this has metadata)
- ‚ùå NOT any file in `dist/` or `client/public/` (these are built files)

### Pull Fresh from GitHub

To be 100% sure what's on GitHub:

```bash
cd "/Users/husseinali/Downloads/CryptoTracker 2/USDFGAMING-full-project/USDFG GitHub/usdfg-site"
git fetch origin
git diff origin/main client/src/lib/chain/config.ts
```

This will show you exactly what's on GitHub. If there's no output, your local matches GitHub perfectly!

## ‚úÖ Verification Commands

Run these to confirm everything is correct:

```bash
# Check local file
grep "PROGRAM_ID" client/src/lib/chain/config.ts

# Should show:
# export const PROGRAM_ID = new PublicKey('7FcxBoY7313QbsyN9oqGvpJBLGw9B984W18RgZgHPpaY');

# Check what's on GitHub
git show origin/main:client/src/lib/chain/config.ts | grep PROGRAM_ID

# Should show the same thing!
```

---

**TL;DR**: Your code IS on GitHub with the new ID. Just hard refresh your browser with `Command + Shift + R`! üîÑ
